  Acts as a checkpoint that scans the NFC/RFID tag from the watch and forwards user data along with pole ID and timestamp.

* **LoRa Communication Layer:**
  Enables long-range, low-power, internet-independent data transfer between system components.

* **Control Panel:**
  Receives and analyzes incoming data, displays real-time user status, GPS coordinates, and alerts on the OLED screen.

* **Emergency Decision Module:**
  Validates SOS alerts, identifies the last crossed pole, and prepares actionable information.

* **Rescue Team / Authorities:**
  Receive verified emergency information to initiate fast and accurate rescue operations.

##  Challenges


*  **Power Supply in Remote Areas**
  Ensuring uninterrupted power for poles, control panels, and wearable devices is challenging. Solar-powered systems are highly dependent on weather conditions such as limited sunlight, rain, or snow.


*  **Hardware Dependency and Reliability**
  The system relies on multiple hardware components such as ESP32, Arduino Nano, LoRa modules, GPS modules, and NFC readers. Failure of any single component can impact overall system performance.

*  **Device Durability in Extreme Conditions**
  Poles and wearable devices must withstand harsh environmental conditions including rain, snow, dust, extreme temperatures, and physical impact, which increases design and maintenance complexity.


*  **Environmental Interference with LoRa Signals**
  Natural obstacles, atmospheric conditions, and electromagnetic interference may degrade LoRa signal quality, affecting data transmission reliability.

---

##✔️  **ROUND 1 FEATURES COMPLETED**


* **1.SIGNAL COVERAGE – Up to 10 km**

  Long-range LoRa communication enables reliable data transmission up to 10 km without internet or cellular networks, making the system ideal for remote and off-grid environments.

* **2.SOS Message Transmission & Reception**

  Users can trigger SOS alerts from the smart watch or tracking pole. The control panel instantly receives the alert along with precise GPS coordinates, enabling fast emergency response.

* **3.Microcontroller Fully Working**

  The system uses **ESP32** in poles and the control panel, and **Arduino Nano** in smart watches, ensuring efficient processing of GPS data, LoRa communication, checkpoint logging, and emergency alerts with low power consumption.

* **4.Checkpoints installed**

  Tracking poles act as checkpints where users tap their NFC-enabled watches. This logs user position and movement, ensuring accurate route monitoring and improved safety tracking.

---

##**⏭️ ROUND 2 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS**


### **1. GPS Location Integration**

Each smart tracking watch is equipped with an integrated GPS module that provides accurate real-time location data. During emergency situations, when the user presses the SOS button, the watch transmits precise GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) to the control panel, enabling rescue teams to locate and assist the user quickly and accurately.


### **2. Extended LoRa Communication Range (Up to 15 km)**

The system uses LoRa for long-range, low-power communication between watches, poles, and the control panel, with an effective range of up to **15 km**.

If a user moves beyond the LoRa coverage area:

* The smart watch stores checkpoint and SOS data locally.
* Once the user re-enters the communication range, the stored data is automatically transmitted to the nearest pole and then forwarded to the control panel.

This improvement ensures **reliable data delivery and zero data loss**, even in extremely remote locations.


### **3. NFC-Based User Identification**

Each smart tracking watch contains a unique NFC tag for secure and accurate user identification. When the user taps the watch on a tracking pole:

* The pole reads the NFC tag.
* The user ID along with checkpoint information is transmitted to the control panel.

This feature prevents user misidentification and ensures precise tracking when multiple users are present on the same route.

*  **Mobile App Dashboard**
  Develop a mobile application to visualize real-time GPS locations of users on an interactive map (e.g., Google Maps). This will make tracking, monitoring, and emergency response more intuitive and accessible.

*  **Cloud Integration**
  Integrate cloud platforms to store tracking data, SOS alerts, and user information. This will enable remote system access, advanced analytics, and historical data management for improved decision-making.

*  **Drone Assistance for Emergencies**
  Deploy drones to deliver medical supplies, communication devices, or emergency materials to users in distress, significantly reducing response time during critical situations.

*  **Enhanced Solar-Powered Devices**
  Further integrate and optimize solar panels for both poles and wearable devices to ensure a sustainable and uninterrupted power supply in remote locations, minimizing reliance on conventional batteries.
